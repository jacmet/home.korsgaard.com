Docker container to retrieve Telenet bandwidth usage

Telenet unfortunately does not have a public API for this, so instead
use selenium to login to "mijn Telenet" and scrape the bandwidth usage
info.

Do use, pass Telenet username and password:

docker run --rm telenet-usage:latest <username> <password>

And the current monthly bandwidth usage in GB will be printed to
stdout.

See get-telenet-usage.sh for an example of publishing this to MQTT,
suitable for a daily cronjob.
